# Ecommerce-Data-Analysis
A manually crafted Python-based data dashboard project that extracts and visualizes insights from real-world e-commerce data — built without auto-generated tools, focusing purely on code-driven analysis and storytelling.

#DataVisualization – Python-Based E-Commerce Data Analysis

Project Description
This project analyzes a real-world E-Commerce dataset using only Python — without dashboards like Power BI or Tableau.  
It demonstrates full-cycle data analysis including data cleaning, visual exploration, insight extraction, and report generation
